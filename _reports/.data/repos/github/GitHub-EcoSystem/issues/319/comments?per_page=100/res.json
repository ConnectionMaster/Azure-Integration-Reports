      "body": "## Objective üéØ \r\n- Understand the depth & breadth of customer engagement with Azure, using GitHub Actions as a pivot\r\n- Build a methodical reasoning to identify action items to further enhance the engagement in a measurable way\r\n\r\n## Scope üëÄ\r\n- ‚úÖ **Organization** | üïô **Individual** \r\nIt's not a choice between the two but really a prioritization call. Our hypothesis based on the initial analysis shows that Organization provides a more representative and discrete cohort which is also accessible for qualitative feedback. These reasons make it an obvious choice as a starting point.\r\n\r\n- üïô **Active** | ‚úÖ **Engaged** | ‚úÖ **Highly Engaged**\r\nGitHub extended the Core 4 metrics with 6 new additions to include some organization specific measures like active, engaged and highly engaged organizations [MAO, MEO & MHEO](https://team.githubapp.com/posts/33976). These metrics provide a natural pivot for alignment since we are exploring a subset of this data.\r\n\r\n  Our analysis shows that deriving any actionable insights for active individual or accounts is hard due to statistically insignificant data. Also with leadership interest on the engaged and dedicated accounts, our current focus is Engaged & Highly Engaged Organizations.\r\n\r\n- üïô **Adoption** | ‚úÖ **Engagement** | ‚úÖ **Churn**\r\nSince we are using GitHub Actions as a lens for our analysis, Engagement and Churn are the factors that we can influence more prominently compared to Adoption. Our assumption is that by the time Actions is used, the choice of cloud infrastructure has already been made in majority of the cases. \r\n\r\n## Framework üèõÔ∏è \r\nFor all the exploration we use a simple framework to baseline current state, build a methodical reasoning & identify relevant action items\r\n- What is the current state (Engagement & Churn)?\r\n- What is the reasoning behind the current state (Engagement & Churn)?\r\n- What actions should be taken?\r\n\r\n## Approach üõ§Ô∏è \r\nWe have created 3 broad categories for our analysis\r\n1. **Breadth**: A measure of the footprint deploying to Azure or other clouds e.g. #repositories. Each repository is a potential candidate for deployment. Larger number of repositories mean more breadth.\r\n2. **Depth**: A measure of the penetration within a candidate that is already deploying to Azure or other clouds e.g. #deployments. Each repository that is deploying can do more e.g. move from active to engaged, engaged to highly engaged etc. \r\n3. **Revenue**: A measure of the contribution to ACR and ARR\r\n\r\n| Categories |              |.                |\r\n| :----------- | :------- | :--------- |\r\n| Breadth  (eng, churn)  | Depth (eng, churn) | Revenue (eng, churn) |\r\n|  <ul><li>- [ ] # repos </li><li>- [ ] # action types </li><li>- [ ] # languages </li><li>- [ ] more... </li></ul> |  <ul><li>- [ ] # jobs </li><li>- [ ] # commits or PR(s) </li><li>- [ ] # avg. contributors </li><li>- [ ] # activity days </li><li>- [ ] more... </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] # acr </li><li>- [ ] # arr </li><li>- [ ] more... </li></ul> |",

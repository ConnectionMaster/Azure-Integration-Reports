    "body": "**Context:**\r\nCurrently GitHub Actions log workflow telemetry into kusto clusters which can help us answer the following business questions:\r\n- How many and what are the GH Repos adopted a given (set of) Action(s).. Example - #Repos that adopted Actions for Azure that we published in Azure Org\r\n- How many #workflow runs/#deployments included a given (set of) Actions(s)\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\n\r\n- Currently we have no way to know the status (Success/Failure) of a given workflow. And hence it is difficult to conclusively state how many unique GH repos actually deployed to Azure and the associated ACR.\r\n_Potential solution:_ \r\nIf we replace the hash of repo name with the actual repo name/repo ID (recommended) in the user agent variable with allows us to link the GH repos to the Azure subscriptions targeted by #Az ARM calls made from various Actions.\r\n\r\n- It is also not possible to find more insights about the specific use cases that a given action is used for. For example, we do not know how often a specific optional input of an action is getting used.\r\n_Potential solution:_ \r\nStore more telemetry during an action execution. However this needs to be done only for all the actions for Azure and hence may not be relevant to capture this telemetry as part of GH actions platform support. We may hence need to maintain our own telemetry metadata store where we could store such additional data.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n- [ ] Telemetry enhancements: Include Repo name in place of hash #41",

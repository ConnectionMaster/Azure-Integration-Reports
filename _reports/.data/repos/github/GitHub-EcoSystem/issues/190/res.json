    "body": "## Summary:\r\n\r\nAzure Policy is one of the popular Azure service among top Azure customers. Nearly 300 out of top 300 Azure customers use it today. However, Azure Policy lacks features like history, traceability, safe deployment etc.  As a part of our solution, we intend to light up these capabilities for our customer. Azure policy as code effort spans across multiple Epics. \r\n\r\n### Problem statement:\r\n - As organizations continue the journey of governance with Azure Policy, the number of policies keeps increasing and quickly becomes unmanageable(Eg, _British Petroleum has nearly 9500 policies and still growing_...). It becomes very hard to track why a policy was created, who created it, who all reviewed/approved policy changes, what changes were made to policy over a period of time. \r\n - New policies and policy updates have a high potential to cause live sites by blocking updates/deployment of production resources. There is no easy/standardized way today for customers to follow safe deployment practices while rolling out policies.\r\n\r\n> _One of the areas that we’re seeing another gap is in the ability to roll out policies in a controlled and “safe” way that would limit the “blast radius” of any policy effect (including in-guest) that might affect users_\r\n\r\n - There is a communication gap between infra admins and developers. Developers are not aware that certain resources/configurations that were created by them is not a recommended practice followed in their organization. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n- [x]  #78 **Azure policy compliance scan action** \r\n\r\nWith the Azure Policy Compliance Scan action, customers can now easily trigger a on demand scan from your GitHub workflow on one or multiple resources, resource groups or subscriptions, and continue/fail the workflow based on the compliance state of resources. They can also use this GitHub Action to generate a report on the compliance state of scanned resources for further analysis or archiving.\r\n\r\n- [x]  #79 **Azure policy definitions and assignment action** \r\n\r\nWith this GitHub Action, customers can now deploy policies using safe deployment practices. This action will look for Azure policy file changes in a GitHub repository and then push changes to Azure policy using customized GitHub workflows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## EPD\r\n\r\nEngineering: @ammohant \r\nProduct:  @raiyanalam \r\nDesign: N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n## Partner Teams:\r\nEngineering: Akif Heren(compliance scans) and Chris Stackhouse(Policy definition and Assgin) \r\nProduct: Liz Kim and Kemley Nieva\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Documents:\r\n\r\n1.

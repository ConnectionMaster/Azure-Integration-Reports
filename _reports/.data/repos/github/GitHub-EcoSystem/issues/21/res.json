    "body": "## Summary:\r\nWith Azure as a trusted cloud platform and with Visual Studio and GitHub (GH) as cloud-powered developer tools, developers can code, collaborate and ship their apps to various Azure developer services. However currently Azure and GitHub are two powerful yet disparate platforms.\r\nTo make various Azure cloud powered experiences more seamlessly accessible for GitHub developers, a new GitHub App for Azure is envisioned to be the central means for various Azure resources to access the meta data of a GitHub repo(s) like commits, PRs, Issues, Workflows, RBAC, Policies, settings etc. \r\n\r\n### MVP scope : \r\nWe are scoping the MVP to addressed the following JTBDs which could help us to enable multiple integration experiences for User persona U1: Azure customers/enterprises who have their code base in GH and are looking for a first-class DevOps tooling experience from within the portal targeting various Azure resources\r\n\r\n- As a U1, I want to integrate my GH repo with various Azure experiences in the portal but **must authenticate with my GH credentials multiple times with each of the Azure resource provider. [P1]**\r\n- As a U1, I want to maintain a clear history of changes done to Azure policies definitions and assignments for review or audit leveraging the new azure policy integration with GitHub but **must individually authenticate and configure GH orgs/repo (s) for each Azure tenants/subscription [P2]**\r\n- As a U1, I want to ensure that only secure and compliant code gets deployed to my Azure resources by leveraging the policy and security features across GH & Azure but **must traverse disconnected UX of GitHub and Azure to correlate and get details. [P3]**\r\n- As a U1, I want to setup and trigger CI/CD workflow runs based on triggers from Azure resources (For example Azure Container Registry, Event grid etc.), but **there is no easy inbuilt experience to setup automatic Azure triggers for GH workflows [P6]**\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n\r\n## EPD\r\n\r\nEngineering: @narula0781 , @richakumar  \r\nProduct:  @N-Usha \r\nDesign: N/A\r\n\r\n## Partner Teams:\r\nEngineering: @Ambika, @bishal-pdMSFT , \r\nProduct: @raiyanalam , @pulkitaggarwl \r\n\r\n## Related Documents:\r\n[GitHub App for Azure](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ReleaseManagement/RM/EUB_vnk3XAJAp64T6SyUmKIBrzeuBQGeGloVtJ3xVcQZmQ?e=ZMOBLH)\r\n\r\n## Customer Connects:\r\nNeed to work with partner teams (Azure Policy, Deployment Center for AKS etc.)  to get customer contacts that we can work with as part of the private preview release.\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria\r\nOKR 2.2 GitHub repos deploying to Azure grows by 50%",

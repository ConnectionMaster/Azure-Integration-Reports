    "body": "## Summary\r\nAs customers start relying on cloud native technologies to bootstrap their application, they introduce dependencies within their app stack. Additionally, as code bases grow, it becomes difficult to ensure code cleanliness without using automated processes to periodically scan and alert for vulnerabilities. So it becomes imperative to get a holistic view of the security posture of applications. Customers also want to employ shift-left strategies and catch and remediate security threats as early in the software lifecycle as possible. \r\nThis epic looks to bridge the gap between shift-left security practices and the ASC runtime.\r\n\r\n**Problem Statement**\r\n- An *azure IT admin* wants to understand what got deployed into his/her azure resource but **doesn't have the traceability into what repo/branch the code came from and which pipeline deployed artifacts to the resource**.\r\n- An *azure IT admin* wants to get a complete picture of what security policies were evaluated for his/her azure resources as part of the CI/CD processes but **doesn't have visibility into which security scans were run on the left side and what were the results**.\r\n- An *azure IT admin* wants to provide remediation steps for failed security policies in shift-left but **doesn't have visibility into what policies were violated on the left side**.\r\n- An *azure IT admin* wants to enforce policies on the left side but **doesn't have the control knob to add policies on the left directly from the Azure portal**.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## EPD\r\nEngineering: @ammohant \r\nProduct: @azooinmyluggage, @anraghun \r\nDesign: n/a\r\n\r\n## Partner Teams:\r\nProduct: ASC team - Sunil Pai (sunil.pai@microsoft.com), Lavanya Kasarabada (lakasa@microsoft.com)\r\n\r\n## Related Documents:\r\n- [ASC Functional Spec](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/AzureServerlessSecurity/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3938C867-F9B5-4B0C-995A-270EFA789910%7D&file=Functional%20Spec-%20CICD%20Integration%20with%20ASC.docx&wdLOR=c7FAC656E-D9F2-B549-9BEE-234DC79658ED&action=default&mobileredirect=true)\r\n- [Draft 1-pager](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/w-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.sharepoint.com%2F%3Aw%3A%2Ft%2FReleaseManagement%2FRM%2FEfZO-oevq55NsGArdXjolO8BAnr3J6_mfxwPb8RjCxOcTg%3Fe%3Dqs7hgJ&data=02%7C01%7CMohammed.Alam%40microsoft.com%7C21f59ce78c6a44f2f99308d810f6693d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637277997798258919&sdata=l3e87NmGSqeGrooR%2B9KohAqOqY%2Bn73bSY%2BOPtgdEJOo%3D&reserved=0) on potential problems and solutions.\r\n\r\n## Customer Connects:\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n```\r\n- [X] Assign this issue to yourself/another individual\r\n- [X] Make sure 'Epic' label is added to the issue\r\n- [X] Link this Epic with an Initiative\r\n- [ ] Link with the features\r\n```",

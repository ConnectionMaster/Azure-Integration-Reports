If a customer does this it will add >20 templates to their repo - will spoil their experience. Any thoughts? Keep only P0 templates or organize with resource/language pivot so they can delete the directories that are not needed.\r\n2) If you have folder structure and an organization copies it, does it show all templates in flat structure or organize them? If it is organizing in folders it probably helps solving #1 and makes it easier as well.\r\n3) Should we be calling this as azure\\action-workflow-templates  as these are templates than samples.\r\n\r\nAssuming this work is in progress, few more to be fixed: \r\n- Guidelines to select/author links needs to be fixed (follow it based on closure on #1)\r\n- No sample of application code at all in any of these repos, https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/workflow-templates/workflow-templates/AppService\r\n- Every template should have comments included so customers know what to change and modify.\r\n",

      "body": "- Only those templates for which the .properties.json are included are only shown in the UX. We could potentially scope the experience to only the selected list of templates by not including the .properties.json for the rest of the templates.  \r\n\r\n- Its always a flat list and the folder structure in the repo dint influence the way the templates show up in the UX. IMO there should have been a filter or search capability on the UX . will check with platform team on this feature ask.\r\n\r\n-  I am fine with the repo name change as well.. Hierarchy change or the repo name change would only break all the existing URLs and need fixing.. we could fix both together if we need to take this change. But any specific reason why 'templates' is a better name? Do you think it has a better brand recall? Also https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-templates repo name is already taken and is getting used by all the integration experiences and we may need to find a new name.\r\n\r\n- This is how the experience shows up when there are more than 6 custom templates and then has a button to shows more templates.  https://github.com/bcstestit/.github/actions/new (@gopinathch - You can play around in this test repo.. Let me know if U don't have access)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25389593/93329047-3c332d80-f83a-11ea-9e1d-77ec4ff2dd15.png)\r\n",

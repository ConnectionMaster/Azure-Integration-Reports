    "body": "## Summary\r\nKubernetes has become the go to orchestrator for containers with widespread adoption. With the growth of arc connected clusters along with the managed AKS clusters, customers are starting to manage/monitor their clusters on the Azure portal. As part of this epic, we will look to provide a seamless integration with Github for these customers.\r\n\r\n**Problem Statement**\r\n- With multitenancy being common on clusters, along with the microservice architecture, different applications get deployed to the cluster. A *cluster admin* wants to know how a cluster has changed post a deployment but is **difficult to pinpoint what was deployed to the cluster, from where and at what time**.\r\n- Monorepos are still a common practice so a single repo might be responsible for deploying to multiple clusters/environments. A *developer* wants to stay on top of whether a deployment succeeded but finds it **difficult to get the deployment statuses to each of the environments**.\r\n- Customers have adopted agile deployment practices and rolling out changes more frequently. A *devops admin* wants to slowly rollout deployments throughout the cluster but has **limited safe deployment strategies for both push and pull based deployments**.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- [ ] Annotations to AKS via actions #17\r\n- [x] Blue/Green deployment strategy for k8s-deploy action #82\r\n- [ ] GH Action for Automated Canary Analysis (ACA) #119\r\n- [ ] GitOps based deployment to AKS #3\r\n- [x] Wrapper action for AKS deployments #16\r\n- [ ] Add support for Secrets Store CSI driver in the k8s-deploy action #83\r\n- [ ] K8s deployments and traceability #6\r\n- [ ] Support kubelogin authentication in aks-set-context #419\r\n\r\n## EPD\r\nEngineering: @ammohant \r\nProduct: @anraghun\r\nDesign: n/a\r\n\r\n## Partner Teams\r\nProduct: Chris Sanders Azure Arc (chris.sanders@microsoft.com)\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria in the order of Priority\r\n\r\nA Github user should be able to deploy (either via push or pull model) to Aks with the following functionality available to them:\r\n\r\n1. From the Aks resource view on the azure portal, they should be able to see the repository, branch and commit information.\r\n2. They should be able to leverage different deployment strategies such as canary and blue-green to deploy to their clusters.\r\n3. From the Github commit, they should be able to view the status of deployment to Aks for one or more clusters.\r\n4. From the Aks resource view on the azure portal, they should be able to see the blast radius of the deployment (changes to the cluster such as scaling of replica sets, introduction of new resources such as services and ingresses etc).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [X] Assign this issue to yourself/individual\r\n- [X] Add the 'Epic' label to the issue\r\n- [X] Link this epic with an initiative",
